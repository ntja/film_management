# Summary of the work:

In that project 5 views has been created:
- 1 view to show paginated list of films.
- 1 view to create a new film.
- 1 view to see the detail of a given film. Below film's information I added a form allowing connected user to post a comment.
- 1 view to create an account
- 1 view to login

To upload the photo of the film I used Drop-zone plugin.

To authenticate an user, I used the JWT token.

Those views are communicating with the APIs to store / retrieve the necessary information through the  implemented endpoints.

The SQL script of the DB structure is located at the root of the project and it is name: db-film.sql and The information of DB connection are in .env file.
